# PWA Online/Offline Budget Tracker [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

As a full-stack developer, we want to be able to add functionality to an  existing application such as this Budget Tracker application. In some cases such as this, we want to be able to allow users offline access and functionality. Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to an applications success.

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, users should be able to populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.

## User Story

```
